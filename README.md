# Theatre Management System
## Project Description
This is a system for theatre management that includes the use of an SQL database. The intended use case for this project is for a theatre chain to manage its locations and its movies on the customer side of the business. This project will allow theater owners to keep track of where the theatre is located, which films, film schedules, the auditoriums where the films are playing, the capacity of the auditoriums, customer subscriptions (including theatre SCENE points (or something analogous)) and theatre guest purchases.
Theatre guests and employees will have different access privileges to the database. Guests will be able to buy tickets, buy food, and view movie showings. Using the database employees will be able to create new movie showings, create memberships, view tickets, and view guest information.

## Database Specification
Keeping track of the films playing, the film schedules, the auditorium capacities and the customer information, will all require use of a database and a way to manage that database. A feature of this project is the customer will be able to have a subscription which will include benefits in the form of discounts and points. In order to keep track of these points and benefits, a database will be required.
